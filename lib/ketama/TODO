== TODO ==

* Merge patches/ for FNV-1a hash, it's significantly faster.
* Better regression tests
* Stress test whilst updating the servers list (tests shm/sem stuff)
* Switch to sockaddr_in / in_addr for server storage in memory.
* Auto-validate server address and port.
* Keep statistics of key requests (most popular, average, total hits)?
* Namespaces for keys?

== BUGS ==

* Invalid sever definition file causes ketama_roll to crash (fixed).
* Removing, adding and removing a server again causes 
  potential stale keys. (not our concern?)
